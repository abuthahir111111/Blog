    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/my_photo.png') }}" alt="">
    <p>I am Abuthahir. A 20 year old aspiring Developer. I am studying in IIT Tirupati (Proud to be an IITian ðŸ˜Š). I like to develop web apps and learn stuff about computers and tech in general. 
        I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, c/c++, etc and know frameworks like bootstrap and Flask. Apart from programming and tech, I like to play PC and mobile games. 
        Especially RPG games and FPS games. I have an interest in sustainable development of human society so that we don't have environmental exploitation and exploitation of workers. 
        I like both dogs and cats. They are sooo cute and are fun to interact with. I watch anime whenever I find some free time. I find it difficult to describe myself as to whether 
        I am an Introvert or an Extrovert. I like to talk to people. But If there are a lot of people (groups of more than 4 people), I tend to avoid them actively. 
        And sadly, I haven't been in an relationship. It is because I was scared to dive into a relationship. I find it hard to propose a girl with a straight face. What she might do?
        I am not scared of rejection. But I am scared that she might secretly hate me and try to humiliate me. This fear started because of the prank culture that we have. 
        There are quite a lot of prank videos on the internet and honestly, I am not a fan of pranks (annoying other person just for personal happiness). I feel that pranks are disgusting.
